For the continuous feature columns, to calculate the likelihood, we first find the mean and standard deviation for each label (so if there's 2 possible labels, there will be 2 sets of mean and standard deviation). We then use the mean and standard deviation to calculate the normal distribution value for each label, which is its likelihood.

    "(a) It's clear that out of the Naive Bayes classifiers, the `NB Num` classifier has the best performance -- it has the lowest error of 0.13 and the highest F1 score of 0.87. `NB Num` is based off `x_train_num` which only contains 8 continuous features, of which contains the strongest feature overall (`Weight`). This classifier is only processing continuous data, oppose to `x_train_num_full` and `x_train_cat_full` which contain both continuous and categorical features, whereby these hybrid models reduce efficiency. The test data's continuous distribution also may align with the model very well.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Standardization should improve the performance of the numeric Naive Bayes classifier. Standardization corrects for datasets that have large variance -- large variance is not good, as it means the normal distribution is more spread out decreasing probability density and joint probability.\n",

    "(c) The drawbacks of fixed-width binning arise if our dataset is sparse, contains several outliers and/or is not distributed evenly. In this event, it's possible that there are heavily populated bins, and potentially bins that aren't populated at all. When applied to a model, this may result in a poor representation of the underlying distribution. A solution is to instead used equal-frequency binning, which ensures all bins are populated relatively evenly, which generally gives better representation.\n",

    "(d) We want to avoid a false diagnosis of obesity -- this means we want to avoid false positives. In this case we want to focus on getting a solid `Precision` score, which is a metric that measures the prevalence of false positives. We already measured the F1 score, which takes into account `Precision`, however it also takes into account `Recall` which has an inverse relationship with `Precision` (meaning F1 cannot be high unless both `Recall` and `Precision` are high). However, we're only interested in `Precision`, so measuring it directly may be better here.\n",
    "\n",
    "(e) Yes, the logistic regression has a notably better accuracy and F1 score of around ~10%. Logistic regression is performed on `x_train_norm_full` which has 31 feature columns. 2 of the Naive Bayes classifiers are only being performed on 16 feature columns. Less features means a higher proporition of the columns are 'strong' -- `Height` and `Weight` are present in all the sets, and these are the strongest features. Because all features are weighted evenly, it means there is a drawback in logistic regression here in that these important features have less overall weight in the 31 feature table. Furthermore, too many features may result in overfitting, which will not be good when we want to apply the model to other datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes assumes that the features in the dataset are all conditionally independent, meaning it has a higher bias. However, if the dataset actually follows the bias then Naive Bayes will outperform logistic regression. Naive Bayes also has lower variance. However, the conditionally independent assumption usually isn't ideal. For example, in the obesity dataset Naive Bayes assumes that `Height` and `Weight` are independent -- this is obviously not the case as there is a connection between them. Logistic regression does not suffer from this naive assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "(f) Compared to other models, when the dataset is extremely large, gradient descent enables us to train our model much more rapidly. Logistic regression also tends to result in lower error than generative models as the dataset size increases. However, logistic regression does still pertain error properties and so will not always achieve perfect test set performance. The paper \"On discriminative vs. generative classifiers: A comparison of logistic regression and naive bayes.\" by authors Ng, Andrew Y., and Michael I. Jordan explores these errors."
